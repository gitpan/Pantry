      $ pantry init
      $ pantry create node foo.example.com
      $ pantry list nodes

DESCRIPTION
    "pantry" is a utility to make it easier to manage a collection of
    computers with the configuration management tool Chef Solo
    <http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Solo>

USAGE
    Arguments to the "pantry" command line tool follow a regular structure:

      $ pantry VERB [[NOUN] [ARGUMENTS...]]

    See the following sections for details and examples by topic.

  Pantry setup and introspection
   init
      $ pantry init

    This initializes a pantry in the current directory. Currently, it just
    creates some directories for use storing cookbooks, node data, etc.

   list
      $ pantry list nodes
      $ pantry list roles
      $ pantry list environments
      $ pantry list cookbooks

    Prints to STDOUT a list of items of a particular type managed within the
    pantry.

  Managing nodes
    In this section, when a node NAME is required, the name is expected to
    be a valid DNS name or IP address. The name will be converted to
    lowercase for consistency. When referring to an existing node, you may
    often abbreviate it to a unique prefix, e.g. "foo" for
    "foo.example.com".

    Also, whenever a command takes a single 'node NAME' target, you may give
    a single dash ('-') as the NAME and the command will be run against a
    list of nodes read from STDIN.

    You can combine this with the "pantry list" command to do batch
    operations. For example, to sync all nodes:

      $ pantry list nodes | pantry sync node -

    Pantry supports grouping nodes into arbitrarily named environments, such
    as "test", "staging" or "production". The node commands "create" and
    "list" can be given an environment selector with the "--env ENV_NAME" or
    "-E ENV_NAME" options and all operations will be happen in the context
    of that environment.

    This works with "list" and input from STDIN for a handy way to sync all
    nodes in an environment:

      $ pantry list nodes -E staging | pantry sync node -

    See ""Managing Environments" for more.

   create
      $ pantry create node NAME

    Creates a node configuration file for the given "NAME".

   rename
      $ pantry rename node NAME DESTINATION

    Renames a node to a new name. The old node data file is renamed. The
    "NAME" must exist.

   delete
      $ pantry delete node NAME

    Deletes a node. The "NAME" must exist. Unless the "--force" or "-f"
    options are given, the user will be prompted to confirm deletion.

   show
      $ pantry show node NAME

    Prints to STDOUT the JSON data for the given "NAME".

   apply
      $ pantry apply node NAME --recipe nginx --role mail --default nginx.port=80

    Applies recipes, roles or attributes to the given "NAME".

    To apply a role to the node's "run_list", specify "--role role" or "-R
    role". May be specified multiple times to apply more than one role.
    Roles will be appended to the "run_list" before after any existing
    entries but before any recipes specified in the same command.

    To apply a recipe to the node's "run_list", specify "--recipe RECIPE" or
    "-r RECIPE". May be specified multiple times to apply more than one
    recipe.

    To apply an attribute to the node, specify "--default KEY=VALUE" or "-d
    KEY=VALUE". If the "KEY" has components separated by periods ("."), they
    will be interpreted as subkeys of a multi-level hash. For example:

      $ pantry apply node NAME -d nginx.port=80

    will be added to the node's data structure like this:

      {
        ... # other node data
        nginx => {
          port => 80
        }
      }

    If the "VALUE" contains commas, the value will be split and serialized
    as an array data structure. For example:

      $ pantry apply node NAME -d nginx.port=80,8080

    will be added to the node's data structure like this:

      {
        ... # other node data
        nginx => {
          port => [80, 8080]
        }
      }

    Both "KEY" and "VALUE" support periods and commas (respectively) to be
    escaped by a backslash.

    If a "VALUE" is a literal string containing 'true' or 'false', it will
    be replaced in the configuration data with actual JSON boolean values.

    N.B. While the term "--default" is used for command line consistency,
    attributes set on nodes actually have what Chef terms "normal"
    precedence.

   strip
      $ pantry strip node NAME --recipe nginx --role mail --default nginx.port

    Strips recipes, roles or attributes from the given "NAME".

    To strip a role to the node's "run_list", specify "--role role" or "-R
    role". May be specified multiple times to strip more than one role.

    To strip a recipe to the node's "run_list", specify "--recipe RECIPE" or
    "-r RECIPE". May be specified multiple times to strip more than one
    recipe.

    To strip an attribute from the node, specify "--default KEY" or "-d
    KEY". The "KEY" parameter is interpreted and may be escaped just like in
    "apply", above.

   sync
      $ pantry sync node NAME

    Copies cookbooks and configuration data to the "NAME" node and invokes
    "chef-solo" via "ssh" to start a configuration run. After configuration,
    the latest run-report for the node is updated in the 'reports' directory
    of the pantry.

   edit
      $ pantry edit node NAME

    Invokes the editor given by the environment variable "EDITOR" on the
    configuration file for the "name" node.

    The resulting file must be valid JSON in a form acceptable to Chef.
    Generally, you should use the "apply" or "strip" commands instead of
    editing the node file directly.

  Managing roles
    In this section, when a role NAME is required, any name without
    whitespace is acceptable. The name will be converted to lowercase for
    consistency. When referring to an existing role, you may often
    abbreviate it to a unique prefix, e.g. "web" for "webserver".

    Also, whenever a command takes a single 'role NAME' target, you may give
    a single dash ('-') as the NAME and the command will be run against a
    list of roles read from STDIN.

    You can combine this with the "pantry list" command to do batch
    operations. For example, to add a recipe to all roles:

      $ pantry list roles | pantry apply role - --recipe ntp

   create, rename, delete, show and edit
    These commands work the same as they do for nodes. The difference is
    that you must specify the 'role' type:

      $ pantry create role web
      $ pantry show role web

   apply and strip
    The "apply" and "strip" commands have slight differences, as roles have
    two kinds of attributes, "default attributes" ("--default" or "-d") and
    "override attributes" ("--override"), with slightly different
    precedence.

      $ pantry apply role NAME -d nginx.user=nobody --override nginx.port=80
      $ pantry strip role NAME -d nginx.user --override nginx.port

    The "--recipe" ("-r") and "--role" ("-R") arguments work the same as for
    nodes. Note that roles can have other roles in their "run_list".

    When Chef merges attribute, the role default attribute has the lower
    precedence than node attributes. Override attributes have higher
    precedence than node attributes. Yes, this is a gross simplification of
    how Chef does it. See Chef docs for more:
    <http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Attributes>

    Roles have two kinds of run lists: default and environment-specific. The
    default run list applies whenever there is no environment-specific run
    list for the active environment for a node. You can apply/strip
    environment-specific run list entries with the "-E ENV_NAME" option, or
    omit it to apply/strip from the default list.

      $ pantry apply role web -r nginx
      $ pantry apply role web -r ufw -E production

  Managing environments
    In this section, when a environment NAME is required, any name without
    whitespace is acceptable. The name will be converted to lowercase for
    consistency. When referring to an existing role, you may often
    abbreviate it to a unique prefix, e.g. "prod" for "production".

    Also, whenever a command takes a single 'environment NAME' target, you
    may give a single dash ('-') as the NAME and the command will be run
    against a list of roles read from STDIN.

    You can combine this with the "pantry list" command to do batch
    operations. For example, to add a default to all environments:

      $ pantry list environments | pantry apply environment - -d nginx.port=8080

    Environments are different than nodes and roles because there are really
    three ways to work with an environment. When you create an environment,
    an environment data file is created to hold attributes. When you create
    a node, it gets assigned to an environment (the "_default" environment
    is used if you don't specify one). However, you can create a node in an
    environment even if you don't create the environment data file first.
    Finally, roles can have environment-specific run lists.

    Here's a summary of those distinctions:

    When you want to affect environment data files, you'll use "pantry VERB
    environment ..." commands, like this:

      $ pantry show environment staging

    When you want to set an environment for node and role actions, you'll
    use the "--env" or "-E" selector option

      $ pantry create node foo.example.com -E test
      $ pantry apply role web -r ufw -E production

   create, rename, delete, show and edit
    These commands work the same as they do for nodes and roles. The
    difference is that you must specify the 'environment' type:

      $ pantry create environment staging
      $ pantry show environment staging

   apply and strip
    The "apply" and "strip" commands work like roles, except that
    environments don't have run lists.

      $ pantry apply environment NAME -d nginx.user=nobody --override nginx.port=80
      $ pantry strip environment NAME -d nginx.user --override nginx.port

    If you want to have different run lists in different environments, you
    have to do that via roles, with environment-specific run lists:

      # turn on firewall in production
      $ pantry apply role web -r ufw -E production

    An environment-specific run list *replaces* the default run list if the
    role is applied to a node in the specified environment.

    Chef Solo does not yet have support for merging environment attributes
    the way Chef Client does. Therefore, during sync, Pantry will do its own
    merge with node attributes to provide a reasonable emulation. The
    precedence is slightly different, but if you have overlapping
    environment, role and node attributes and the order is really important
    to you, you're probably over-complicating things. See Chef docs for
    more: <http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Attributes>

  Managing cookbooks
    Pantry does very little to manage cookbooks -- this is left up to you
    and you are free to do whatever you like in the "cookbooks" directory.

    As a convenience, however, Pantry may be used to create an empty
    boilerplate cookbook for you to customize:

      $ pantry create cookbook my-cookbook

  Getting help
   commands
      $ pantry commands

    This gives a list of all pantry commands with a short description of
    each.

   help
      $ pantry help COMMAND

    This gives some detailed help for a command, including the options and
    arguments that may be used.

AUTHENTICATION
    "pantry" relies on OpenSSH for secure communications with managed nodes,
    but does not manage keys itself. Instead, it expects the user to manage
    keys using standard OpenSSH configuration and tools.

    The user should specify SSH private keys to use in the ssh config file.
    One approach would be to use the "IdentityFile" with a host-name
    wildcard:

      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/identities/id_dsa_%h

    This would allow a directory of host-specific identities (which could
    all be symlinks to a master key). Another alternative might be to create
    a master key for each environment:

      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_dsa_dev
      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_dsa_test
      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_dsa_prod

    "pantry" also assumes that the user will unlock keys using "ssh-agent".
    For example, assuming that ssh-agent has not already been invoked by a
    graphical shell session, it can be started with a subshell of a
    terminal:

      $ ssh-agent $SHELL

    Then private keys can be unlocked in advance of running "pantry" using
    "ssh-add":

      $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_dsa_test
      $ pantry ...

    See the documentation for "ssh-add" for control over how long keys stay
    unlocked.

ROADMAP
    In the future, I hope to extend pantry to support some or all of the
    following:

    *   tagging nodes

    *   searching nodes based on configuration

    *   data bags

    *   encrypted data bags (or equivalent functionality)

    *   cookbook download from Opscode community repository

    *   bootstrapping Chef over ssh

    If you are interested in contributing features or bug fixes, please let
    me know!

SEE ALSO
    Inspiration for this tool came from similar chef-solo management tools.
    In addition to being implemented in different languages, each approaches
    the problem in slightly different ways, neither of which fit my
    priorities. Nevertheless, if you use chef-solo, you might consider them
    as well:

    *   littlechef <http://github.com/tobami/littlechef> (Python)

    *   pocketknife <http://github.com/igal/pocketknife> (Ruby)
